## Hi! I'm Luke.

I'm a developer with a background in electronic engineering and audio technology.

I'm currently working my way through The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp, as well as my own project [**Unwind Chimes**](https://sukelully.github.io/unwind-chimes).

P.S. I didn't start coding in March... Changing my GitHub email removed a lot of contributions :(
